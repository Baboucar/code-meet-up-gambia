# Log - Code Meet-up Gambia - Abd Al-Ala Camara

## Week 1: 9 - 15 June, 2017.

This week for the freecode camp meet up i build a tribute page and a suvey form i managed read a bit about ARIA(Accessibe rich internet appliation) which makes sure your site  can be accessed by screen readers. I use raw css to style both projects because they are thay small projects.

## THE TRIBUTE PAGE
The tribute page basically consist of a main container , inside it you have a tile plus  other section containg the logo , the details of the page, quote , more information  and a footer.

## THE SUVEY FORM
the suvey form consist of three sections  the banner, the form section and a footer.

**Thoughts:**
if you have any suggestion please feel free to let me know thak you.
